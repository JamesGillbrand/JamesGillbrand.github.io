# About

I am James Gillbrand, an undergraduate Applied Math and Economics student at the University of Chicago. This website is a collection of my work from classes, personal projects, and other programs. A large chunk of the work as of now are my typset math problem sets with LaTeX, but I hope to fill it out with some personal python projects, write-ups, and my REU notes and paper.
